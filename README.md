I want make this project as simple as possible.
Have fun~

External npm package usage:

### clsx
In the reason of the composing multi class style in one element.
I take this module for a convenient solution.

### react-jss
For the usage of writing css in js.
The one I am familiar with is materi-ui, but this time I just need a css-complier. Aslo that will support a better way let me ueuse the style.

Other Resource:
### FontAwesome Icon
Include this package by CDN.
Benefit: accelerate user-end to load the Icon resource.
Why not use image as icon?
Ans: In the most of website, images were the bottleneck of bandwidth and sometimes will cause the pixel issue to address. If choose svg icon. More lighter and woundn't bother of pixel.
